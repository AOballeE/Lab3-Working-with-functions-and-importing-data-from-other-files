<h1>Lab 3 - Working with functions and importing data from other files </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab project we will be importing data from other files to go through the database 
and look for any names that are siimilar in the database while using if/else and elif statement 
in python. While this project did not compile and run, I was having issues with my function name
not being defined but other than that the idea of my code worked fine but I could not debug the issue on 
my own and my professor eventually showed me what went wrong after my assignment was graded.
